###Introduction
Although Steam has changed from green to blue not much else has changed with the interface as a whole. With a custom theme you are able to use Steam more easily and have a more appealing interface as well.


###Installing Themes

1. ####Download the theme files

2. ####Add files to `skins` directory
Navigate to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\skins` and create a new directory containing the theme files.

3. ####Select the theme

	Open Steam and select `settings` from the `Steam` menu dropdown. Then select `interface` and choose the Steam skin from the `skin` dropdown.

4. ####Restart Steam
