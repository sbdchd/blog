When [placing an order online via Toast](https://order.toasttab.com/online/exodus-bagels-roslindale), you're presented with two options for paying:

- Express checkout with Toast

- Checkout as a guest

<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;padding: 10px 0px;">
<img src="/assets/toast-checkout.png" style="border-radius: 20px;" width="400" alt="2 buttons for checkout, one labeled express checkout with toast, the other labeled checkout as a guest">
</div>

## Express checkout with Toast flow

1. Phone number input for a login code

   iOS autofills the phone so pretty quick to fill out thankfully.

2. Code verification input

   iOS autofills once the text message arrives.

3. Payment page, option for Apple Pay or credit card

   If you had saved your credit card before, maybe this would be quicker, but I prefer using Apple Pay, so it was all empty.

4. Apple Pay screen

   Bog standard payment screen builtin to iOS.

5. Done!

Overall, longer than it needs to be and didn't actually help me since I ended up paying with Apple Pay.

## Checkout as guest flow

1. Payment page, option for Apple Pay or credit card

   Same payment page as step 3 in the "express" flow, I selected Apple Pay again rather than filling out credit card info.

2. Apple Pay screen

   Bog standard payment screen builtin to iOS.

3. Done!

## Conclusion

Guest checkout is much quicker and easier taking 15 seconds vs 28 seconds for Toast express checkout!
