###Introduction
Adding or editing objects such as buildings, store locations, or large regions such as national parks is relatively straight forward in Google Map Maker but adding trails using GPS data is not. 

This tutorial will cover the basics associated with adding a trail to Google Maps, from setup to the final publishing.

###Using the Track Kit App for iPhone
The first thing that you are going to have to do is download the [Track Kit App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/track-kit-gps-tracker-offline/id871209106?mt=8), which can be sometimes be found for [free](http://appshopper.com/navigation/track-kit-gps-tracker).

####Recording a Trail

1. To begin recording the trail simply tap the `red circular record button` in the upper left hand corner of the screen
2. Then proceeded to walk / run / drive / bike your trail
3. Once finished, tap the `record button` again and select `save track` when prompted
4. Make sure that you add a name to the path that you can remember

####Transferring Map File
You are then going to want to email the map file that you created to yourself for later use. Do this by the following.

1. Tap the center trail icon located at the bottom of the screen
2. Then select `Tracks` on the left side of the menu
3. Click the iOS `share` button to the right of your trail map name
4. Email the file to yourself

###Adding Recorded Trails to Google Maps
Before continuing, make sure that you received trail file link via email.

1. Open the link in your email
2. In the blue box **right click** on `KML` and copy the link address
3. Open [Google Map Maker](http://www.google.com/mapmaker)
4. Click on the `Cog` in the upper right hand corner of the page and select `Labs`
5. `Enable` Overlays and exit back to the main screen
6. Now click on the `Overlays` button that should now appear in the upper right hand corner selecting `manage overlays`
7. Under the KML section, paste your URL from the Track Kit file clicking `add` and then `okay`.
The new path should appear on the map although it may take a few seconds for it to appear.

####Adding Trail Data to Google Maps
Although the trail appears on your screen, the data has not been transferred into Google Maps. 
This process needs to be done by hand, tracing the trail with the `Trail / Path` drawing tool or the respective tool for what item you are adding.

1. Select the red `ADD NEW` from the Google Map Maker menu then selecting the `Add Roads, Rivers, Railways`
2. Then select the type of item you are adding such as a `Trail / Path`
3. Once you have selected the appropriate tool, simple click along your trail line as accurately as possible. 
You can double click to end the path and then edit the path, adjusting points with your mouse. If you want to delete a point, simply right click on the point and select `Delete this point`.
4. Once you have finished editing your path double click on a point and simple hit `Save and continue to add`.
You may have to fill in additional information depending how many past edits you have and the significance of the change.
