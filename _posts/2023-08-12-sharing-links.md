When sharing a link from an app or website there are a few options for tracking.

Some apps include unique ids in query params when sharing, which are pretty easy to remove as a user:

- Instagram

  <https://www.instagram.com/p/Cupv5rCM55G/?igshid=MTIzZWMxMTBkOA==>

Some create a unique id and use that in the URL, which you can't get around easily:

- TikTok

  <https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT88VGe67/>

- Snapchat

  <https://t.snapchat.com/Q8p9PR5p>

Some include [urchin tags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTM_parameters) or similar but nothing unique:

- Reddit

- LinkedIn
