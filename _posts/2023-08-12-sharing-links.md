When sharing a link from an app or website there are a few options for tracking.

Some apps include unique ids in query params when sharing, which are pretty easy to remove as a user:

Some create a unique id and use that in the URL, which you can't get around easily:

Some include [urchin tags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTM_parameters) or similar but nothing unique:
