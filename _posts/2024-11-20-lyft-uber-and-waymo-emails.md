Of these companies, their receipt emails are pretty similar with:

| Item                     | Description                                                                            |

| Total Price              | \$29.56                                                                                |
| Pick Up Time & Location  | Hook Fish Co, 4542 Irving Street 5:58 PM                                               |
| Drop Off Time & Location | Fairmount San Francisco 950 Mason St 6:28 PM                                           |
| Personalization          | include your name in the email                                                         |
| Support Link             | Contact support, Help Center, etc.                                                     |

But Lyft and Uber also have:

- Driver's Name
- Tip Amount, CTA to Tip, Rate Driver CTA
- Map

## Conclusion

I think the map is neat, but it makes the emails longer than necessary.

Waymo doesn't need anything tipping or driver related, which makes their emails even more concise and the nicest of the three.
