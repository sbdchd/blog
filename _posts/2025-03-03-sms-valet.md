The valet at the hotel has this neat ticket system using SMS.

<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;">
<img src="/assets/sms-valet-ticket.jpeg" height="600" alt="valet ticket with qr code for sending text message">
</div>

The ticket is two parts (see top perforation), one stays with the car, and the one you keep has a phone number to text. If you scan the QR code, iMessage will open with the number and message body pre-filled, all you have to do is hit send!

Decoding the QR code I get:

```
smsto:415-942-5782:158692
```

So pretty simple to setup, no website required.

And if the QR code doesn't work for you, you can always type in the number manually or head down to the valet.
