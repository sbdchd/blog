## Overview

When ordering food via an app, you get integrated order status tracking, but if you order in person, you don't.

Usually you give them a name and they'll call you or you take a number and they'll bring the food out to you.

However, Hey Tea has a nice way of connecting in-person orders with in-app tracking.

## The Flow

The printed receipt includes a QR code that you can scan with your phone.

</div>

This deep links into the [Hey Tea app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/heytea/id6468945008) and loads the order details with a live status and estimated wait time.

The QR code is only valid for one account, so once you scan it, the order becomes associated with your account and someone else can't scan it.
