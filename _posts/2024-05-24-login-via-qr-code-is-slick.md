Discord, TikTok, and Steam all support scanning QR codes to login:

It's a pretty quick way to login, the only caveat is you need to have their
mobile app installed.

And because of this, services / sites / projects without mobile apps can't support this login method.

## Confirming

There's also some security risk where an attacker gets a user to scan a QR code the attacker generated on their own computer, allowing them access to the user's account.

Steam's confirm page does the best job at attempting to prevent this attack:

<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;">

</div>

Discord has a general warning:

<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;">
<img src="/assets/qr-code-login-confirm-discord.png" height="700" alt="discord qr code login confirm">
</div>

While TikTok is pretty sparse:

<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;">
<img src="/assets/qr-code-login-confirm-tiktok.png" height="700" alt="tiktok qr code login confirm">
</div>

## Conclusion

This login method is nice, but requires users to have the service's app downloaded.
